Note the following files were generated, you will need this info when running
testrunner.sh in a different server, they are also saved in test_files.properties.
- Files used by test plan:
$FILE_NAMES_TEST_PLAN

Now you can:
- Change the site configuration
- Change the cache stores
And to continue with the test you should:
- Run restart_services.sh (or manually restart web and database servers if
  this script doesn\'t suit your system)
- Run test_runner.sh
